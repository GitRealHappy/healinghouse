                    <div class="more-text reiki-expanded-content">
                        <p>An Usui Master Reiki treatment begins with a short consultation to identify focus areas and answer any questions. All treatments are draped and clients have the option of remaining clothed or removed clothing, as they feel the most comfortable. The treatment starts with cleansing the auric field using light breath work, guided meditation and singing bowl sound vibration. Once the space is cleared, the subtle energetic frequencies of Usui Reiki are offered to the client's body through intuitive touch (or without touch, if preferred). The treatment finishes with a final singing bowl cleanse to clear the body of any residual energies that were released during treatment and seal the treatment. The session ends with a short check-in and any notes about aftercare.</p>
