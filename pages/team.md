        <div class="bio-text">
            <p class="bio-intro">Sophie began her career as a body worker in Ontario after graduating from the College of Orthotherapy program in 2005. Since then, she has worked in five-star Hotel spas in Ontario, Quebec and Vancouver.<span class="dots">...</span></p>
            <div class="more-text">
                <p>She loves helping people so she quickly understood how much massage treatments have a positive impact in people's lives. It is that passion and dedication to the wellness of others that prompted her to expand her knowledge of the physiology and anatomy of the human body, to learn new techniques and deepen her commitment to better the lives of others. So, she returned to school to become a Registered Massage Therapist. She graduated from the Vancouver College of Massage Therapy (VCMT) in 2016.</p>
                <p>Sophie has a relaxation and therapeutic approach to her treatments. She uses a variety of techniques and modalities such as Swedish massage, trigger point release, myofascial, joint mobilization, passive and active stretching. She specializes in treating pre- and post-natal conditions, postural dysfunctions, tension headaches, migraines, overuse injuries and stress related conditions. In her spare time, she enjoys reading, hiking, working out, yoga, dancing and traveling. She is a dog lover and a tea enthusiast. Sophie is excited and grateful to be part of the Healing House.</p>

        <h3>Laura Anctil, MA, CLBD</h3>
        <p class="team-title">Certified Usui Reiki Master & Ritual Practitioner</p>
        <div class="bio-text">
            <p class="bio-intro">Hi! I'm Laura (she/they) and I identify as a white, queer womxn of Italian and Celtic ancestry, currently residing on Stó:lō unceded land, the traditional territory of the Semá:th and Mathxwí First Nations.<span class="dots">...</span></p>
            <div class="more-text">
                <p>I'm a Certified Usui Reiki Master and Ritual Practitioner, and a member of the International Association of Reiki Practitioners. I'm also a Certified Birth and Labour Doula and trauma-informed secondary support for Psychedelic Assisted Psychotherapy. I'm passionate about companioning others on their journey with somatic presencing, compassionate witnessing, and unconditional positive regard. I'm also deeply invested in learning about anti-racist and anti-oppressive ways of being, and cultivating right relationship with our planet and its inhabitants.</p>
                <p>Before learning energy work, I completed an MA in Cultural, Social and Political Thought, and this training taught me to view healing from a holistic and systemic perspective. I strongly believe that reconnection with the body is an important step to reconciliation and learning healthy reconnection with all O/others. On my days off, I like magikal adventures in the woods with family, friends and familiars; singing loudly while driving, playing in different bands, poring over ancient and contemporary texts, and tending to my outdoor garden sanctuary.</p>
