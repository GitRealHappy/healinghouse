        <p class="team-title">Founder & Senior Therapist</p>
        <p>Milan Peters graduated from the Registered Massage Therapy program at CDI College in 2019. She brings a holistic approach to treatment aware of the interconnectedness of the body and mind. At fourteen years old she was diagnosed with Crohn’s disease and has since learned to manage a chronic illness and still live a joy-filled life. Her own journey towards health inspires her to help others on their paths towards healing. Milan tailors each treatment to the individual’s needs and mindfully addresses specific concerns and goals. Her treatment style often includes Swedish massage techniques, myofascial release, active and passive stretching and trigger point release in a gentle way to help restore function in the body and encourage nervous system regulation.</p>

        <h3>Sophie Sarazin, RMT</h3>
        <p class="team-title">Senior Therapist</p>
        <p>Sophie began her career as a body worker in Ontario after graduating from the College of Orthotherapy program in 2005. Since then, she has worked in five-star Hotel spas in Ontario, Quebec and Vancouver. She loves helping people so she quickly understood how much massage treatments have a positive impact in people’s lives. It is that passion and dedication to the wellness of others that prompted her to expand her knowledge of the physiology and anatomy of the human body, to learn new techniques and deepen her commitment to better the lives of others. So, she returned to school to become a Registered Massage Therapist. She graduated from the Vancouver College of Massage Therapy (VCMT) in 2016. 

Sophie has a relaxation and therapeutic approach to her treatments. She uses a variety of techniques and modalities such as Swedish massage, trigger point release, myofascial, joint mobilization, passive and active stretching. She specializes in treating pre- and post-natal conditions, postural dysfunctions, tension headaches, migraines, overuse injuries and stress related conditions.
